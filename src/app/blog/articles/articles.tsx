This can mislead users and reduce trust in the application. \n- **[Answer Relevance](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/evaluation/generation/answer-relevance)**: The model may provide off-topic responses or not directly addressing the user’s query, affecting the application's usefulness. \n- **[Readability](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/evaluation/generation/flesch-kincaid)**: The generated text may be grammatically correct but awkward or difficult to read, hampering user understanding and engagement.",

A shorter TTFT enhances the perceived responsiveness of the application. \n- **Time Per Output Token (TPOT):** The time taken to generate each subsequent token after the first one. Reducing TPOT can improve the overall generation speed. \n- **Total Generation Time:** The cumulative time required to generate the entire response. \n- **Speed:** This measures how many tokens the model can generate per second. Higher speed indicates better performance and a smoother user experience. \n- Latency Calculation: Latency is calculated as TTFT + (TPOT * number of tokens to be generated).

This metric considers the question, context, and answer to ensure the output is informative and concise.\n\n  **Hallucination** \n\n Hallucination determines if the LLM output contains made-up information, while faithfulness measures the factual consistency of the answer against the given context. An answer is deemed faithful if all its claims can be inferred from the context, with higher scores indicating better faithfulness.",

It calculates the precision for each matching n-gram (n consecutive words) between the generated and expected outputs, determining their geometric mean and applying a brevity penalty if needed. \n - **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** ROUGE evaluates text summaries by comparing n-gram overlaps between LLM outputs and expected outputs. Key variants include ROUGE-L, which measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) reflecting sentence-level word order; ROUGE-N, which assesses unigram, bigram, trigram, and higher-order n-gram overlap; and ROUGE-S, which evaluates skip-gram concurrence allowing for arbitrary gaps between words. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of text similarity and relevance.\n - **BERTScore**: it leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT to match words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. Emerging as an alternative to traditional evaluation metrics, BERTScore is particularly useful for evaluating the quality of text summarization by measuring the similarity between the text summary and the original text.

However, as of mid-2024, numerous models are available, each with its own strengths. Options now include Mistral-7B, Cohere Command-R, Meta LLaMA 2, and GPT-4. \n- **Prepare your custom dataset:** Gather a dataset relevant to your specific task or domain. Once you have the raw data, preprocess it by cleaning and organizing it. This includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model can learn effectively and be appropriately evaluated. \n- **Fine-tuning:** Choose a fine-tuning platform to train your model or opt to train it in-house, depending on your resources and requirements. \n- **Validation:** Fine-tuning a model is an ongoing process. Continuously monitor its performance using accuracy, loss, and precision metrics. Adjust parameters as needed to optimize the model for your specific task, ensuring it meets your desired performance standards.",

        text: "Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) involves a supervised learning process where labeled examples adjust the model’s weights to enhance its proficiency in specific tasks. Here are some notable techniques used in fine-tuning: \n\n **Full Fine-Tuning (Instruction Fine-Tuning)** \n\n Instruction fine-tuning, or full fine-tuning, updates all the model's weights to improve its performance across various tasks. This technique involves training the model on examples that guide its responses to specific queries. The dataset used is tailored to the task at hand, such as summarization or translation. Full fine-tuning creates a new version of the model with enhanced capabilities, but it requires significant memory and computational resources, similar to pre-training, to store and process gradients, optimizers, and other components during training. \n\n **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is more resource-efficient than full fine-tuning. It addresses the challenge of high memory and computational requirements by updating only a subset of the model's parameters and \"freezing\" the rest. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, making memory requirements more manageable and preventing catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information. PEFT maintains the original LLM weights, ensuring the retention of general knowledge while fine-tuning for specific tasks. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) are popular and effective methods within PEFT, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and optimizing the fine-tuning process.",

By utilizing different LLMs with similar performance levels, you can effectively manage and optimize your rate limits. This approach ensures that no single model is overwhelmed, thereby reducing the likelihood of hitting rate limits and maintaining smooth operations. \n\nFor instance, Keywords AI’s load balancing feature allows you to easily control your LLM rate limits by distributing requests among various models. You can use models like Anthropic Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT-3.5-turbo simultaneously, specifying their weights to balance the load efficiently. \n\nIn the example below, 50% of your requests are directed to Claude 3 Haiku, while 25% go to GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini 1.5 Flash each:\n\n ",

This option is viable but typically requires significant expenditure for approval. \n- **Use OpenAI’s Batch API:** For use cases that do not require synchronous processing, OpenAI’s asynchronous Batch API is an excellent option. It offers higher rate limits and is more cost-effective than synchronous processing. However, responses can take up to 24 hours, making it unsuitable for real-time applications. \n- **Build Your Own Load Balancing Solution:** If data privacy is a concern, building your own load balancing solution might be the best route. While this approach ensures full control over your data, it requires significant effort and technical expertise. Leveraging third-party packages can help streamline this process, but it will still demand considerable time and resources.",

This is vital for ensuring a great user experience - nobody wants to waste time on AI apps that constantly generate errors. For instance, if you're using OpenAI's API to call models like GPT-4o or GPT-4 Turbo, you might notice frequent incidents and elevated error rates. Your job is to handle all of this in your backend, ensuring users never see these errors. \n\n Ways to implement a fallback system: \n- Build your own: Integrate models from different providers. If you're using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash, consider also integrating Claude 3 Haiku and GPT-4 Mini into your product. They offer similar performance! The quickest way is to use an LLM gateway to access these models with a consistent format. Check out [the LLM gateway provider](https://docs.keywordsai.co/integration/supported-models). Then you could try to catch the exceptions and then switch to other models. \n- Choose a third-party fallback system: While you could build everything in your backend, it might take many hours of work. Alternatively, [the fallback system on Keywords AI](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/generation/fallbacks) is super simple. Just add your desired fallback models on their website, and they'll handle all LLM outages for you. It takes just 1 minute to set up and ensures 0 seconds of downtime.",

As a developer or startup founder, you should always dream big and have a robust plan in place to handle sudden spikes in usage. Here are two effective strategies to increase your LLM rate limits: \n- If you have a substantial spending history with a provider, you can request a manual increase in your rate limits. While this option is viable, it typically requires significant expenditure and can be a slow process. Waiting for provider approval can result in downtime and potential loss of users. Therefore, while this method is viable, it shouldn't be your only line of defense. \n- Load Balancing LLM Requests: A more dynamic and efficient approach is to load balance your LLM requests across different models or accounts. This method is straightforward and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. By distributing requests among various models or creating multiple accounts, you can handle large volumes of traffic seamlessly.

However, I also wanted to offer Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o as premium options. To efficiently integrate multiple LLMs, I needed an AI gateway that could call different models using the same format. \n\n The solution: Keywords AI's LLM proxy, which supports 200+ LLMs using a unified format and offers additional functionalities. I utilized its OpenAI SDK framework to call these three models. When a user selects their preferred model in the front end, the corresponding model ID is passed to the Keywords AI API.",

It includes **10,000 logs**, enough to test your product prototype or even engage with initial customers. If you exceed 10,000 logs, our usage-based pricing ensures you only pay for what you use. \n\n **For early-stage startups: Team Plan** \n\n For startups with high LLM usage or those managing multiple projects, the new **Team Plan** at **$49 per seat/month** is the best choice. It offers more free logs each month and more affordable usage pricing. You can also create multiple teams to monitor different projects separately. \n\n The Team Plan is the all-in-one solution for teams aiming to scale quickly.

It was hard for them to justify purchasing a product that exceeded their budget. \n\n After careful consideration, we decided to introduce an additional plan tailored for these developers. This is why we launched our **Pro Plan**. For the price of a cup of coffee, they can access a dedicated product to help monitor, debug, and improve their AI apps. \n\n Similarly, with the new Team Plan, we wanted to give users the flexibility to choose how much they are willing to pay. They might not need extensive monitoring but have a team that needs to conduct prompt experiments or collaborate on prompts. With this plan, they only pay for seat fees instead of log fees.",

The former guides the LLM to explain its reasoning process step-by-step, like solving a math problem by showing the intermediate calculations, leading to more accurate and insightful problem-solving. Response ranking involves generating multiple potential responses to a given prompt and then using a separate mechanism to rank those responses based on their quality, relevance, and coherence.\n\n**True multimodality**\n\nOne of the most exciting prospects of GPT-5 is its possibly seamless multimodal capabilities. While there has been incremental improvement in GPT-4 turbo and GPT-4o, it still shows a deficiency in how it integrates and processes different forms of data like images, audio, and videos. GPT-5 is expected to remove these barriers, enabling more fluid interactions with mixed media. Users will be able to provide inputs in images, or videos, and GPT-5 will process them together, responding with richer and contextually aware outputs.\n\n\n**Improved confidence measures**\n\nPrevalent LLMs are still struggling to conceptualize modern science and professional expertise. This knowledge gap can lead to inaccurate or fabricated responses, often referred to as hallucinations, when the model generates responses and contains unfamiliar information. Integrating methods such as logprobs, fine-tuning, or positive framing could provide valuable insights into GPT-5's confidence levels for each response. The breakthrough will be crucial for users, especially when researchers rely on the results from GPT-5.",

She sells 12 and divides the rest equally among 3 boxes. How many cookies are in each box? First, 30 - 12 = 18 cookies remain.

        text: "LLM debugging finds and fixes errors in large language model apps. It's crucial for building AI that's accurate, fast, and fair. \n\n **Definition and Purpose** \n\n LLM debugging goes beyond regular code fixes. It's about making AI models give correct, useful answers. The main goals? \n- Fix wrong info \n- Speed up responses \n- Remove unfair bias \n\nHere's a real-world example: In March 2023, a big bank's AI chatbot gave bad financial advice. Their stock dropped 2%. Good debugging could've stopped this costly mistake.",

Try this: \n\n- Turn on **Verbose Mode** for key event update \n\n- Enable **Debug Mode** for a full event log \n\nIn Jupyter or Python, just use `set_verbose(True)` and `set_debug(True)` to get detailed logs. \n\n**Implement Tracing** \n\nFor complex apps, tracing is your friend. LangSmith Tracing helps you log and visualize events, making it easier to spot issues. \n\n**Create a Knowledge Base** \n\nBuild a go-to guide for common issues. Include: \n\n- Detailed error descriptions \n- Steps to reproduce issues \n- Verified solutions and fixes \n\nThis saves time and helps your team learn from past challenges. \n\n**Isolate and Reproduce Bugs** \n\nFound a bug? Here's what to do: \n\n1. Isolate it with minimal code \n- Strip away unnecessary components \n- Focus on core functionality \n\n2. Make and test assumptions \n- Document your hypotheses \n- Test one variable at a time \n\n3. Repeat until fixed \n- Keep iterating systematically \n- Document successful fixes"
