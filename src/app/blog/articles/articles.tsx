This can mislead users and reduce trust in the application. \n- **[Answer Relevance](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/evaluation/generation/answer-relevance)**: The model may provide off-topic responses or not directly addressing the user’s query, affecting the application's usefulness. \n- **[Readability](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/evaluation/generation/flesch-kincaid)**: The generated text may be grammatically correct but awkward or difficult to read, hampering user understanding and engagement.",

A shorter TTFT enhances the perceived responsiveness of the application. \n- **Time Per Output Token (TPOT):** The time taken to generate each subsequent token after the first one. Reducing TPOT can improve the overall generation speed. \n- **Total Generation Time:** The cumulative time required to generate the entire response. \n- **Speed:** This measures how many tokens the model can generate per second. Higher speed indicates better performance and a smoother user experience. \n- Latency Calculation: Latency is calculated as TTFT + (TPOT * number of tokens to be generated).

This metric considers the question, context, and answer to ensure the output is informative and concise.\n\n  **Hallucination** \n\n Hallucination determines if the LLM output contains made-up information, while faithfulness measures the factual consistency of the answer against the given context. An answer is deemed faithful if all its claims can be inferred from the context, with higher scores indicating better faithfulness.",

It calculates the precision for each matching n-gram (n consecutive words) between the generated and expected outputs, determining their geometric mean and applying a brevity penalty if needed. \n - **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** ROUGE evaluates text summaries by comparing n-gram overlaps between LLM outputs and expected outputs. Key variants include ROUGE-L, which measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) reflecting sentence-level word order; ROUGE-N, which assesses unigram, bigram, trigram, and higher-order n-gram overlap; and ROUGE-S, which evaluates skip-gram concurrence allowing for arbitrary gaps between words. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of text similarity and relevance.\n - **BERTScore**: it leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT to match words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. Emerging as an alternative to traditional evaluation metrics, BERTScore is particularly useful for evaluating the quality of text summarization by measuring the similarity between the text summary and the original text.

For example, GPT-3 can be fine-tuned with medical reports to help it understand and generate accurate medical content. This makes the model more useful for particular applications, improving its performance in specialized areas while retaining its broad language skills."

Options now include Mistral-7B, Cohere Command-R, Meta LLaMA 2, and GPT-4. \n- **Prepare your custom dataset:** Gather a dataset relevant to your specific task or domain. Once you have the raw data, preprocess it by cleaning and organizing it. This includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure the model can learn effectively and be appropriately evaluated. \n- **Fine-tuning:** Choose a fine-tuning platform to train your model or opt to train it in-house, depending on your resources and requirements. \n- **Validation:** Fine-tuning a model is an ongoing process. Continuously monitor its performance using accuracy, loss, and precision metrics. Adjust parameters as needed to optimize the model for your specific task, ensuring it meets your desired performance standards."

        text: "Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) involves a supervised learning process where labeled examples adjust the model’s weights to enhance its proficiency in specific tasks. Here are some notable techniques used in fine-tuning: \n\n **Full Fine-Tuning (Instruction Fine-Tuning)** \n\n Instruction fine-tuning, or full fine-tuning, updates all the model's weights to improve its performance across various tasks. This technique involves training the model on examples that guide its responses to specific queries. The dataset used is tailored to the task at hand, such as summarization or translation. Full fine-tuning creates a new version of the model with enhanced capabilities, but it requires significant memory and computational resources, similar to pre-training, to store and process gradients, optimizers, and other components during training. \n\n **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is more resource-efficient than full fine-tuning. It addresses the challenge of high memory and computational requirements by updating only a subset of the model's parameters and \"freezing\" the rest. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, making memory requirements more manageable and preventing catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information. PEFT maintains the original LLM weights, ensuring the retention of general knowledge while fine-tuning for specific tasks. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) are popular and effective methods within PEFT, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters and optimizing the fine-tuning process."

By utilizing different LLMs with similar performance levels, you can effectively manage and optimize your rate limits. This approach ensures that no single model is overwhelmed, thereby reducing the likelihood of hitting rate limits and maintaining smooth operations. \n\nFor instance, Keywords AI’s load balancing feature allows you to easily control your LLM rate limits by distributing requests among various models. You can use models like Anthropic Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT-3.5-turbo simultaneously, specifying their weights to balance the load efficiently. \n\nIn the example below, 50% of your requests are directed to Claude 3 Haiku, while 25% go to GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini 1.5 Flash each:\n\n ",

This option is viable but typically requires significant expenditure for approval. \n- **Use OpenAI’s Batch API:** For use cases that do not require synchronous processing, OpenAI’s asynchronous Batch API is an excellent option. It offers higher rate limits and is more cost-effective than synchronous processing. However, responses can take up to 24 hours, making it unsuitable for real-time applications. \n- **Build Your Own Load Balancing Solution:** If data privacy is a concern, building your own load balancing solution might be the best route. While this approach ensures full control over your data, it requires significant effort and technical expertise. Leveraging third-party packages can help streamline this process, but it will still demand considerable time and resources.",

For instance, if you're using OpenAI's API to call models like GPT-4o or GPT-4 Turbo, you might notice frequent incidents and elevated error rates. Your job is to handle all of this in your backend, ensuring users never see these errors. \n\n Ways to implement a fallback system: \n- Build your own: Integrate models from different providers. If you're using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash, consider also integrating Claude 3 Haiku and GPT-4 Mini into your product. They offer similar performance! The quickest way is to use an LLM gateway to access these models with a consistent format. Check out [the LLM gateway provider](https://docs.keywordsai.co/integration/supported-models). Then you could try to catch the exceptions and then switch to other models. \n- Choose a third-party fallback system: While you could build everything in your backend, it might take many hours of work. Alternatively, [the fallback system on Keywords AI](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/generation/fallbacks) is super simple. Just add your desired fallback models on their website, and they'll handle all LLM outages for you. It takes just 1 minute to set up and ensures 0 seconds of downtime.",

As a developer or startup founder, you should always dream big and have a robust plan in place to handle sudden spikes in usage. Here are two effective strategies to increase your LLM rate limits: \n- If you have a substantial spending history with a provider, you can request a manual increase in your rate limits. While this option is viable, it typically requires significant expenditure and can be a slow process. Waiting for provider approval can result in downtime and potential loss of users. Therefore, while this method is viable, it shouldn't be your only line of defense. \n- Load Balancing LLM Requests: A more dynamic and efficient approach is to load balance your LLM requests across different models or accounts. This method is straightforward and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. By distributing requests among various models or creating multiple accounts, you can handle large volumes of traffic seamlessly. For a detailed guide on how to implement load balancing, check out our article: [How to Increase Your LLM Rate Limits for Free!](https://keywordsai.co/#/blog/how-to-increase-your-llm-rate-limits-for-free).",
