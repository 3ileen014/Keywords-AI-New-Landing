# 5 Best Practices for LLM Application Monitoring

LLM apps need careful watching. Here's how to do it right:

1.  **Track key metrics**: Accuracy, latency, cost, user engagement
2.  **Set up alerts**: Choose metrics, set thresholds, plan actions
3.  **Check data quality**: Define standards, use tools, monitor over time
4.  **Test for security**: Use [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) Top 10, control access, watch logs
5.  **Use LLM-specific tools**: [Langsmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/), [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/), [Keywords AI](https://www.keywordsai.co/)

Why it matters:

-   Keeps AI apps reliable and safe
-   Catches mistakes and biases
-   Saves money on resources
-   Protects user data

| Tool | Best For | Free Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Langsmith | Rating responses | 5,000 traces/month |
| Helicone | Easy setup | 50,000 logs/month |
| Keywords AI | AI startups | 10,000 logs |

Remember: LLM monitoring is ongoing. Keep learning and improving your process.


## Track Key Metrics

Keeping your LLM app running smoothly? It's all about watching the right numbers. Here's what you need to track:

**Accuracy**: Is your LLM getting it right? This is key for quality.

**Latency**: Speed counts. Watch these:

-   Time to First Token (TTFT)
-   Time Per Output Token (TPOT)

**Cost**: LLM requests can hit your wallet hard. Some might set you back $1-5 each.

**User Engagement**: Are folks actually using your LLM?

| Metric | What It Tells You |
| --- | --- |
| Bounce Rate | Users who open but don't use |
| Retention Rate | Users who come back |
| Goal Completion Rate | Users who finish a task |

**Customer Satisfaction**: Happy users = successful LLM.

| Metric | Aim For |
| --- | --- |
| CSAT Score | 80% (industry standard) |

**Self-Service Rate**: Users solving problems solo.

**Escalation Rate**: Chats handed to human support.

These metrics work as a team. High accuracy but low engagement? Your LLM might be correct but not helpful.

Want to improve? Pick one or two metrics tied to your main goals. Check often, tweak your LLM as needed.

## 2\. Set Up Alert Systems

Alert systems are crucial for your LLM app. They help you catch issues fast and get user feedback.

Here's how to set up effective alerts:

1\. **Pick your metrics**

Choose what to track based on your app's goals. This might include accuracy, latency, or user engagement.

2\. **Set thresholds**

Decide when an alert should trigger. For example:

| Metric | Alert Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| Accuracy | Below 95% |
| Latency | Above 500ms |
| User Complaints | More than 5 per hour |

3\. **Choose alert channels**

Pick how you'll get notified. Options include Slack, email, SMS, or [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).

4\. **Create an action plan**

Know what to do when an alert fires. This might mean checking data quality, adjusting model parameters, or pausing the service for fixes.

5\. **Gather user feedback**

Set up ways for users to report issues or give input. This could be through in-app feedback forms, user surveys, or support ticket analysis.

6\. **Use anomaly detection**

Spot weird patterns that might signal problems. Tools like [Edge Delta](https://edgedelta.com/use-cases/anomaly-detection) can help with this.

7\. **Test your system**

Make sure alerts work as planned. Run drills to check response times and processes.

Keep improving your alert system. What you track today might not be what you need tomorrow.

> "Rapid adoption showed we needed solid monitoring to keep quality high as we grew." - Akshay Kothari, Notion CPO

This quote from Notion's launch of AI features shows why good alerts matter. As your LLM app grows, your alert system helps you stay on top of quality and performance.

## 3\. Check Data Quality

Data quality can make or break your LLM app. Bad data? Bad results. Simple as that.

Here's how to keep your data clean:

1\. **Set quality standards**

What's "good data" for your app? Define it. Example:

| Aspect | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Completeness | 99% of fields filled |
| Accuracy | 95% match with source |
| Consistency | No conflicting info |
| Timeliness | Updated within 24 hours |

2\. **Use data validation tools**

Tools like [Telmai](https://www.telm.ai/products/data-quality/) can spot issues automatically:

-   Imbalanced labels
-   Mixed-up attributes
-   Truncated values

3\. **Monitor key metrics**

Track data quality over time. Watch for drops.

4\. **Clean and preprocess**

Before feeding data to your LLM:

-   Fill in missing values
-   Remove outliers
-   Scale data as needed

5\. **Check for bias**

Look for unfair patterns. They can lead to biased LLM outputs.

6\. **Document everything**

Keep records of sources, changes, and quality checks. It helps with troubleshooting and compliance.

Data quality isn't a one-time thing. It's ongoing. Keep checking and improving to keep your LLM app running smoothly.

Your LLM app is only as good as its data. Make quality a top priority.

## 4\. Test for Security Flaws

LLM apps can be a hacker's playground. You need to test for security issues regularly.

Here's how:

1\. **Use the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**

OWASP lists the top 10 security risks for LLM apps:

| Risk | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt Injection | Hackers use sneaky prompts to make LLMs do bad things |
| Insecure Output Handling | LLM outputs cause problems if not handled right |
| Sensitive Info Disclosure | LLMs accidentally spill private data |

Start your security checks here.

2\. **Lock Down Access**

Only let the right people touch your LLM stuff. Use RBAC and give people just what they need.

3\. **Watch the Logs**

Keep an eye on who's poking around your LLM systems. Set alarms for weird activity.

4\. **Hire Hackers (The Good Kind)**

Get ethical hackers to try breaking in. They'll find weak spots you might miss.

5\. **Hunt for Data Leaks**

LLMs can blurt out secrets. Use tools to catch these slip-ups early.

6\. **Update Everything**

Keep your LLM and related systems patched up.

7\. **Filter the Output**

Set up strong filters to catch and block risky info in what the LLM spits out.

Don't slack on security. Make it a constant part of your LLM app monitoring.

## FAQs

### How to monitor LLM outputs?

To keep tabs on LLM outputs, focus on these areas:

-   Quality: Are responses clear and sensible?
-   Relevance: Do answers match the questions?
-   Sentiment: What's the tone like?
-   Security: Any potential risks or harmful content?

Use automated tools to track these metrics. Set up alerts for issues. And don't forget real user feedback - they often catch things tools miss.

### What are the 5 pillars of LLM observability?

The 5 pillars of LLM observability:

1\. LLM evaluation

These pillars give you a peek under the hood of your LLM system.

### What's the difference between LLM observability and monitoring?

Think of it this way:

| LLM Monitoring | LLM Observability |
| --- | --- |
| Tracks specific metrics | Provides full system visibility |
| Tells you IF something's wrong | Helps you figure out WHY |
| Uses predefined measurements | Allows deeper exploration |
